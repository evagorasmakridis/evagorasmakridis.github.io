I am currently a second year Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree student in Autonomous Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology holding a scholarship with EIT Digital. I received my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Informatics at Cyprus University of Technology in June 2017. In parallel with my studies, I was working as internship student in the industry at Cyprus. After my B.Sc. graduation I worked as a Research Assistant at Aalto University, Finland and at the University of Lincoln, United Kingdom through the Erasmus+ placement. Currently I am pursuing my M.Sc. thesis on "Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management" at Ericsson AB.
