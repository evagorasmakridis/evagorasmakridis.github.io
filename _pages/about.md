Evagoras Makridis is a recent Master of Science (M.Sc.) graduate of [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://kth.se) and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi), specializing in Autonomous Systems, and holding an excellence scholarship from [EIT Digital](https://www.eitdigital.eu). He received his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Informatics at [Cyprus University of Technology](https://www.cut.ac.cy) in June 2017. During his studies, he worked as an intern in both academia and industry. During his undergraduate studies, he worked as intern at the [Cyprus Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works](http://www.mcw.gov.cy), and at [SignalGenerix](https://www.signalgenerix.com), while after his B.Sc. graduation he worked as Research Assistant at the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk) (United Kingdom) through the Erasmus+ placement, and at Aalto University (Finland). Following his B.Sc. degree, he joined [TRG Research and Development](https://www.trgint.com) as a Full-stack software developer until he admitted to his M.Sc. programme with EIT Digital when he moved to Finland and Aalto University to start his master studies. During this period of time he mainly worked in academia as a Research Assistant in both Aalto University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, until he joined [Ericsson AB](https://www.ericsson.com/en) to pursue his M.Sc. thesis "Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management in 5G-NR Networks".
